# Cuda - Deep Learning Library

A C/C++ library for efficient use of neural networks. <br/>
The library is intended to provide very low level interfaces to train neural networks, to enable users to avoid unnecessary, expensive, computational overhead in their applications. <br/>
The library is currently at a very early stage, and a lot of important functionality has not yet been implemented.
